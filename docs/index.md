Here is an example how to do it in MarkDown for user VuokkoH:

```

```
## Publishing the maps 

In order to access the files via the links, you need to set the repository as public and adjust the GitHub pages settins
## My maps

Edit the text below and add links to the maps that you have created:

 - [My static map](https://autogis-2020.github.io/exercise-5-taigako/jumbo_accessibility_car.png)
     My static map displays travel times (up to 70 minutes) to Jumbo shopping center by car from each
     grid cell in the Helsinki metropolitan area.
 - [My interactive map](https://autogis-2020.github.io/exercise-5-taigako/heatmap.html)
     My interactive map is a heatmap of HSL city bike stations in Helsinki and Espoo in 2020.
     It also displays the stations as markers with address information.
 You can check syntax for formatting the links in here:
